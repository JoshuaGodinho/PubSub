The broker application is the central component that manages message broadcasting and queue management between publishers and subscribers. It receives messages from the publisher backend, processes them, and ensures they are distributed to the relevant subscribers using multicast. The broker also maintains system health through leader election, replication, and heartbeat protocols to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. It is implemented using Express, MySQL, and Node.js, facilitating efficient message handling and system resilience.
