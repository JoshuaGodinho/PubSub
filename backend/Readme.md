The backend application serves as the backbone for the frontend interfaces, handling all the business logic, data processing, and interactions with the database. For publishers, the backend saves messages to a MongoDB database and communicates with the broker for message dissemination. For subscribers, it manages user authentication and retrieves news updates from the broker. The backend is implemented using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, ensuring robust and efficient data handling.
